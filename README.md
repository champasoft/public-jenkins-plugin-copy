# Twistlock Jenkins plugin


#### 1. Overview

Twistlock provides a Jenkins plugin that lets you incorporate vulnerability scanning into your continuous integration pipeline.

The Jenkins plugin is delivered with your Twistlock release.

#### 2. Build and scan flow

After Jenkins builds an artifact, the Twistlock plugin scans it for vulnerabilities and compliance issues.

Twistlock can pass or fail a build, depending on the types of vulnerability and compliance issues discovered, and the policies you set up in Console.

By incorporating scanning into the build phase of the development workflow, engineers get immediate feedback about what needs to be fixed.

The scan report provides all the information required to fix the vulnerabilities.
